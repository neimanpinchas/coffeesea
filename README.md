# coffeesea
so its `coffeesea == coffee-c == coffeescript for c == coffeescript did for javascript what coffeesea did for c`


#C
- C is powerful
- Has trust on the Programmers (which we utilize for safety, not for mess)
- Cross hardware/platform
- Unique tricks
- Programs are small and lightweight


- Libraries are a mess
- Strings breaks the flow
- Automatic memory don't survive the stack frame, other option is manual memory, nothing in between. 

#List of languages considerable
- Go (slower, no tricks)
- Rust (no trust, government grade security)
- C++
- Nim
- Dart
- Vlang
- OOC

#Should satisfy
- Must be able to integrate with current Projects.
- Do not reinvent the framework, just the syntax.
- Added framework , should atleast be interoperable from C, if i want need.
- Include list comprehensions like in python, ruby (hard with static typing, but possible)
- Minimal degree of type infersion.
- Include pipelining as UFCS (most mess happens with those variables)
- Prototype friendly

#new ideas
- Infer the function signatures from a comment above the function, with test case(s) like 4=add(2,2.) so it knows its int add(float,float)
- $| means pipe a char[] using UFCS, %|==pipe an int etc.

##Must update links here will update soon
